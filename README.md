## Tasks

Develop a simple web application page that allows users to view and filter product lists from the database. Use React and Redux to create an interface and manage the state of the application. Interact with the API to extract and save data from the database.

1. Create an application that consists of several components: a title, a search field, a list of products, and a form for adding a new product.

2. Use React Router to create application routes that allow users to navigate between pages.

3. Use Redux to manage the state of your app. Create reducer and actions that allow you to add, remove, and update products.

4. Create a product list component that receives data from the Redux store and displays it as a table with columns: ID, name, description, price, photo, rating, stock, category. Add the ability to sort and filter the product by each column.

5. Add a search box that allows users to search for products by name or category. The product list component should be updated automatically when the user enters a query in the search field.

6. Create a form for adding a new product. Use Formik and Yup to validate the entered data. The form must contain the following fields: title, author, year of publication, rating.
   Add the option to remove an item from the list and from the Redux store.
